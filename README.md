# Social Media Content Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a content recommendation system for a leading social media platform. The primary goal is to enhance user engagement by delivering personalized, relevant, and diverse content to users based on their behavior and preferences.

## Algorithms Used

1. **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB):** Used for balancing exploration and exploitation in content recommendations.
2. **Fairness Constrained Q-learning:** Ensures fairness and diversity in content recommendations.
3. **Deep Q-learning:** Handles complex recommendation environments using neural networks.
4. **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN):** Captures structural information from user-item interactions in social networks.


## Installation

To run this project, we need Python and the following libraries:

- numpy
- torch
- torch_geometric
  

we can install the required packages using pip:
