Social Media Engagement Enhancer

Overview

This project aims to enhance user engagement on a leading social media platform by developing and refining the content recommendation algorithm. The focus areas include user behavior analysis, algorithm performance improvement, and promoting content diversity.

Features
User Behavior Analysis: Understanding user behavior and preferences to predict and recommend engaging content.

Algorithm Performance: Enhancing the recommendation algorithm's performance to deliver real-time, personalized content.

Content Diversity: Ensuring a diverse range of content is recommended to prevent echo chambers.

Algorithms Used:

Q-learning with Fairness Constraints: An off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a Q-table to store and update Q-values for state-action pairs, with added fairness constraints to ensure diverse and unbiased recommendations.

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN): Used for analyzing user interactions on social networks and learning user embeddings.

Collaborative Filtering: A traditional recommendation technique that leverages user-item interactions to predict user preferences.
